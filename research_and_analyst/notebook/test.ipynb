It is commonly referred to as \"the cloud\".\\n\\n\\n== Characteristics ==\\nIn 2011, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) identified five \"essential characteristics\" for cloud systems. Below are the exact definitions according to NIST:\\n\\nOn-demand self-service: \"A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider.\"\\nBroad network access: \"Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations).\"\\nResource pooling: \" The provider\\'s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand.\"\\nRapid elasticity: \"Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time.\"\\nMeasured service: \"Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.\\nBy 2023, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) had expanded and refined the list.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nThe history of cloud computing extends to the 1960s, with the initial concepts of time-sharing becoming popularized via remote job entry (RJE). The \"data center\" model, where users submitted jobs to operators to run on mainframes, was predominantly used during this era. This was a time of exploration and experimentation with ways to make large-scale computing power available to more users through time-sharing, optimizing the infrastructure, platform, and applications, and increasing efficiency for end users.\\nThe \"cloud\" metaphor for virtualized services dates to 1994, when it was used by General Magic for the universe of \"places\" that mobile agents in the Telescript environment could \"go\". The metaphor is credited to David Hoffman, a General Magic communications specialist, based on its long-standing use in networking and telecom. The expression cloud computing became more widely known in 1996 when Compaq Computer Corporation drew up a business plan for future computing and the Internet. The company\\'s ambition was to supercharge sales with \"cloud computing-enabled applications\". The business plan foresaw that online consumer file storage would likely be commercially successful. As a result, Compaq decided to sell server hardware to internet service providers.\\nIn the 2000s, the application of cloud computing began to take shape with the establishment of Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 2002, which allowed developers to build applications independently. In 2006 Amazon Simple Storage Service, known as Amazon S3, and the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) were released. In 2008 NASA\\'s development of the first open-source software for deploying private and hybrid clouds.\\nThe following decade saw the launch of various cloud services. In 2010, Microsoft launched Microsoft Azure, and Rackspace Hosting and NASA initiated an open-source cloud-software project, OpenStack. IBM introduced the IBM SmartCloud framework in 2011, and Oracle announced the Oracle Cloud in 2012. In December 2019, Amazon launched AWS Outposts, a '), Document(metadata={'title': 'Blue–green deployment', 'summary': 'In software engineering, blue–green deployment is a method of installing changes to a web, app, or database server by swapping alternating production and staging servers.', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue%E2%80%93green_deployment'}, page_content='In software engineering, blue–green deployment is a method of installing changes to a web, app, or database server by swapping alternating production and staging servers.\\n\\n\\n== Overview ==\\nIn blue–green deployments, two servers are maintained: a \"blue\" server and a \"green\" server. At any given time, only one server is handling requests (e.g., being pointed to by the DNS). For example, public requests may be routed to the blue server, making it the production server and the green server the staging server, which can only be accessed on a private network. Changes are installed on the non-live server, which is then tested through the private network to verify the changes work as expected. Once verified, the non-live server is swapped with the live server, effectively making the deployed changes live.\\nUsing this method of software deployment offers the ability to quickly roll back to a previous state if anything goes wrong. This rollback is achieved by simply routing traffic back to the previous live server, which still does not have the deployed changes. An additional benefit to the blue–green method of deployment is the reduced downtime for the server. Because requests are routed instantly from one server to the other, there is ideally no period where requests will be unfulfilled.\\nThe blue–green deployment technique is often contrasted with the canary release deployment technique and it has similarities with  A/B testing.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nDan North and Jez Humble encountered differences between their test environments and the production environment while running Oracle WebLogic Server for a client sometime around 2005. To ensure safe deployment, they introduced a method where the new application version was deployed alongside the live system. This approach allowed for thorough testing and easy rollback in case of issues. The team initially considered naming these environments A and B but decided against it to avoid the perception that one was primary and the other secondary. They instead chose color-based names like blue, green, orange, and yellow, eventually using only blue and green since \"having two was sufficient\". This naming convention was adopted while working on the original Continuous delivery book published in 2010  and became a common term in the industry afterwards.\\n\\n\\n== Benefits and challenges ==\\nBlue–green deployment is widely recognized for its ability to reduce downtime during application updates and minimize the risk of introducing defects into production environments. By maintaining two separate environments—blue (the current live environment) and green (the environment with the updated version)—traffic can easily be switched between the two, ensuring that updates are rolled out without disrupting users. This method enables quick rollback in case of deployment failure, thus improving overall system resilience and user experience.\\nWhile blue–green deployment reduces risks during updates, it also requires additional resources since two environments need to be maintained simultaneously. The cost of running duplicate infrastructure, even temporarily, can be prohibitive for smaller organizations. Furthermore, complex database migrations may pose challenges, as the system must ensure that both the blue and green environments have consistent data. Solutions to these issues often involve using database migration tools that allow for backward compatibility between environments.\\n\\n\\n== Implementation ==\\nThere are several approaches to implementing blue–green deployments, each offering varying levels of automation and ease of use depending on the platform and tools available.\\n\\n\\n=== AWS CodeDeploy ===\\nAWS CodeDeploy facilitates blue–green deployments by automating the entire process across services such as Amazon EC2 and AWS Lambda. The service shifts traffic between the old (blue) environment and the new (green) environment, minimizing downtime and ensuring a smooth transition.

Serverless computing is a broad ecosystem that includes the cloud provider, Function as a Service (FaaS), managed services, tools, frameworks, engineers, stakeholders, and other interconnected elements, according to Sheen Brisals.\\n\\n\\n== Overview ==\\nServerless is a misnomer in the sense that servers are still used by cloud service providers to execute code for developers.  The definition of serverless computing has evolved over time, leading to varied interpretations. According to Ben Kehoe, serverless represents a spectrum rather than a rigid definition. Emphasis should shift from strict definitions and specific technologies to adopting a serverless mindset, focusing on leveraging serverless solutions to address business challenges.\\nServerless computing does not eliminate complexity but shifts much of it from the operations team to the development team. However, this shift is not absolute, as operations teams continue to manage aspects such as identity and access management (IAM), networking, security policies, and cost optimization. Additionally, while breaking down applications into finer-grained components can increase management complexity, the relationship between granularity and management difficulty is not strictly linear. There is often an optimal level of modularization where the benefits outweigh the added management overhead.\\nAccording to Yan Cui, serverless should be adopted only when it helps to deliver customer value faster. And while adopting, organizations should take small steps and de-risk along the way.\\n\\n\\n== Challenges ==\\nServerless applications are prone to fallacies of distributed computing. In addition, they are prone to the following fallacies:\\n\\nVersioning is simple\\nCompensating transactions always work\\nObservability is optional\\n\\n\\n=== Monitoring and debugging ===\\nMonitoring and debugging serverless applications can present unique challenges due to their distributed, event-driven nature and proprietary environments. Traditional tools may fall short, making it difficult to track execution flows across services. However, modern solutions such as distributed tracing tools (e.g., AWS X-Ray, Datadog), centralized logging, and cloud-agnostic observability platforms are mitigating these challenges. Emerging technologies like OpenTelemetry, AI-powered anomaly detection, and serverless-specific frameworks are further improving visibility and root cause analysis. While challenges persist, advancements in monitoring and debugging tools are steadily addressing these limitations.\\n\\n\\n=== Security ===\\nAccording to OWASP, serverless applications are vulnerable to variations of traditional  attacks, insecure code, and some serverless-specific attacks (like Denial of Wallet). So, the risks have changed and attack prevention requires a shift in mindset.\\n\\n\\n=== Vendor lock-in ===\\nServerless computing is provided as a third-party service. Applications and software that run in the serverless environment are by default locked to a specific cloud vendor. This issue is exacerbated in serverless computing, as with its increased level of abstraction, public vendors only allow customers to upload code to a FaaS platform without the authority to configure underlying environments. More importantly, when considering a more complex workflow that includes Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS), a BaaS offering can typically only natively trigger a FaaS offering from the same provider. This makes the workload migration in serverless computing virtually impossible. Therefore, considering how to design and deploy serverless workflows from a multi-cloud perspective could mitigate th'), Document(metadata={'title': 'Elastic cloud storage', 'summary': \"An elastic cloud is a cloud computing offering that provides variable service levels based on changing needs.\\nElasticity is an attribute that can be applied to most cloud services.

Privacy concerns remain a primary issue, as users often lose direct control over their data once it is stored on servers owned and managed by cloud providers. This loss of control can create uncertainties regarding data privacy, unauthorized access, and compliance with regional regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).

These risks are often amplified by human error or a lack of understanding of the shared responsibility model. Security responsibilities also vary depending on the service model—whether Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), or Software as a Service (SaaS). In general, cloud providers are responsible for hardware security, physical infrastructure, and software updates, while customers are responsible for data encryption, identity and access management (IAM), and application-level security. \\nAnother significant concern is uncertainty regarding guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS), particularly in multi-tenant environments where resources are shared among customers.

Bezos chose the Seattle area for its abundance of technical talent from Microsoft and the University of Washington, as well as its smaller population for sales tax purposes and the proximity to a major book distribution warehouse in Roseburg, Oregon. Bezos also considered several other options, including Portland, Oregon, and Boulder, Colorado. The company, originally named Cadabra, was founded in the converted garage of Bezos\\'s house for symbolic reasons and was renamed to Amazon in November 1994. The Amazon website launched for public sales on July 16, 1995, and initially sourced its books directly from wholesalers and publishers. Bezos retained the URL www.relentless.com, which he purchased when considering a name for the company; it redirects to the Amazon homepage.\\nAmazon went public in May 1997.

The startup initially developed a platform for live video streaming and geolocation data to assist emergency call centers.\\nThe company rebranded to Carbyne in early 2018 – a name referencing an extremely strong allotrope of carbon. By 2018 Carbyne had raised about $24 million in venture funding (including backing from Founders Fund, the first Israeli startup in that fund’s portfolio) and was valued near $100 million.\\nIn April 2019, the company began collaborating with Cisco, the network equipment giant, to incorporate their hardware into its systems. Two months later, Carbyne announced a partnership with Google to integrate Android phone location services into emergency command centers across Mexico.\\nCarbyne established its headquarters in New York City in October 2019 while maintaining R&D operations in Tel Aviv, and it expanded with offices in the United States, Mexico, Europe, India, and Ukraine.\\nIn 2025, it secured a $100 million funding round led by strategic partners like AT&T, and reported deployments in roughly 300 emergency response centers worldwide.\\n\\n\\n== Products ==\\nCarbyne develops cloud-based “Next Generation 911” (NG911) solutions aimed at modernizing emergency communication. Its platform enables real-time transmission of rich data from callers to public safety answering points (PSAPs). For example, when a distress call is made, Carbyne’s system can provide the 911 dispatcher with the caller’s precise GPS location, live video feed from the caller’s smartphone camera, audio streaming, text messaging, and other telemetry in parallel with the voice call. The company offers both an app-based service and an app-free option. With the Carbyne mobile app (previously called “C-Now”), users can pre-install it on iOS or Android to automatically send video and location data during an emergency call.\\nAlternatively, Carbyne’s web-based feature (known as “C-Lite”) allows a 911 center to text an auto-generated URL link to a caller, which when tapped activates the phone’s camera and streams video and location to the dispatcher – all without requiring the caller to have any app installed. Both methods are cloud-native and work with legacy 911 infrastructure by creating an over-the-top data channel, enabling quick deployment with minimal changes to existing call centers. Carbyne claims its technology can significantly improve response efficiency (reducing emergency response times by up to 65% on average) by providing first responders with critical situational information before they arrive on scene.

Based in New York City, 10gen was founded by former DoubleClick founder and CTO Dwight Merriman and former DoubleClick CEO and Gilt Groupe founder Kevin P. Ryan with former DoubleClick engineer and ShopWiki founder and CTO Eliot Horowitz and received $81 million in venture capital funding from Flybridge Capital Partners, In-Q-Tel, Intel Capital, New Enterprise Associates (NEA), Red Hat, Sequoia Capital, and Union Square Ventures. 10gen originally aimed to build a platform as a service architecture based entirely on open source components; however, the company was unable to find an existing database platform that met their principles for a cloud architecture. As a result, the company began to develop a document-oriented database system it called MongoDB. After realizing the potential of the software on its own, 10gen's team decided to scrap its cloud platform and focus on maintaining MongoDB instead. In February 2009, 10gen released MongoDB as an open source project. 10gen opened its first west coast office in August 2010, having offices in Palo Alto, Reston, London, Dublin, Barcelona, and Sydney by 2012.\\nIn September 2012, 10gen was in The Wall Street Journal's The Next Big Thing 2012.\\nOn August 27, 2013, 10gen announced that it would change its name to MongoDB Inc., associating itself more closely with what became its flagship products.\\nIn 2013, the Identification Authority of India adopted MongoDB's software to analyze registration trends for new identity documents used to obtain government benefits in India.

MongoDB filed for an initial public offering on September 21, 2017 and went public on NASDAQ that October 20. It raised $192 million, valuing the company at $1.6 billion overall. Its market capitalization varied greatly afterwards, reaching $39 billion in 2021 and coming back down to $10 billion by 2024.\\nMongoDB acquired database engine company WiredTiger in 2014, followed by database-as-a-service company MLab for $68 million in 2018. The following year, in 2019, MongoDB acquired a mobile-focused database company called Realm for $39 million.\\nA secondary public offering was held on June 29, 2021. In 2022, MongoDB established its own venture capital fund.\\n\\n\\n== Software ==\\nAs of 2025, MongoDB was the fifth most popular database software. It focuses mostly on managing large databases of unstructured data. It's typically used for mobile and web apps that commonly use unstructured databases. As of 2024, there were 50,000 MongoDB customers. MongoDB was originally best known as a NoSQL database product. The company released a database as-a-service product called Atlas in 2016 that became 70 percent of MongoDB's revenue by 2024.

It aims at building, testing, and releasing software with greater speed and frequency. The approach helps reduce the cost, time, and risk of delivering changes by allowing for more incremental updates to applications in production. A straightforward and repeatable deployment process is important for continuous delivery.\\n\\n\\n== Principles ==\\nAccording to Neal Ford, continuous delivery adopts \"Bring the pain forward,\" tackling tough tasks early, fostering automation and swift issue detection. \\nContinuous delivery treats the commonplace notion of a deployment pipeline as a lean Poka-Yoke: a set of validations through which a piece of software must pass on its way to release. Code is compiled if necessary and then packaged by a build server every time a change is committed to a source control repository, then tested by a number of different techniques (possibly including manual testing) before it can be marked as releasable.\\nDevelopers used to a long cycle time may need to change their mindset when working in a CD environment. Any code commit may be released to customers at any point. Patterns such as feature toggles can be very useful for committing code early which is not yet ready for use by end users. Using NoSQL can eliminate the step of data migrations and schema changes, often manual steps or exceptions to a continuous delivery workflow. Other useful techniques for developing code in isolation such as code branching are not obsolete in a CD world, but must be adapted to fit the principles of CD - for example, running multiple long-lived code branches can prove impractical, as a releasable artifact must be built early in the CD process from a single code branch if it is to pass through all phases of the pipeline.\\n\\n\\n== Deployment pipeline ==\\n\\nContinuous delivery is enabled through the deployment pipeline. The purpose of the deployment pipeline has three components: visibility, feedback, and continually deploy.\\n\\nVisibility – All aspects of the delivery system including building, deploying, testing, and releasing are visible to every member of the team to promote collaboration.\\nFeedback – Team members learn of problems as soon as possible when they occur so that they are able to fix them as quickly as possible.\\nContinually deploy – Through a fully automated process, you can deploy and release any version of the software to any environment.\\n\\nAccording to Yan Cui, when it comes to serverless environments, ephemeral resources should be kept together and have their own deployment pipeline to achieve a high cohesion. However, shared resources that have a long spin-up time and landing zone should have their own separate repository, deployment pipeline and stack. \\n\\n\\n== Tools/tool types ==\\nContinuous delivery takes automation from source control all the way through production. There are various tools that help accomplish all or part of this process. These tools are part of the deployment pipeline which includes continuous delivery. The types of tools that execute various parts of the process include: continuous integration, application release automation, build automation, application lifecycle management.\\n\\n\\n== Architecting for continuous delivery ==\\nTo practice continuous delivery effectively, software applications have to meet a set of architecturally significant requirements (ASRs) such as deployability, modifiability, and testability. These ASRs require a high priority and cannot be traded off lightly.\\nMicroservices are often used when architecting for continuous delivery.

It also has the ability to store and process content close to cellular subscribers, for faster response time. Applications can also be exposed to real-time radio access network (RAN) information.\\nThe key element is the MEC application server, which is integrated at the RAN element. This server provides computing resources, storage capacity, connectivity and access to RAN information. It supports a multitenancy run-time and hosting environment for applications.  The virtual appliance applications are delivered as packaged operating system virtual machine (VM) images or containers incorporating operating systems and applications. The platform also provides a set of middleware application and infrastructure services. Application software can be provided from equipment vendors, service providers and third-parties.\\n\\n\\n== Deployment ==\\nThe MEC application server can be deployed at the macro base station EnodeB that is part of an LTE cellular network, or at the Radio Network Controller (RNC) that is part of a 3G cellular network and at a multi-technology cell aggregation site. The multi-technology cell aggregation site can be located indoors or outdoors.\\n\\n\\n== Business and technical benefits ==\\nBy using mobile edge computing technology, a cellular operator can efficiently deploy new services for specific customers or classes of customers. The technology also reduces the signal load of the core network, and can host applications and services in a less costly way. It also collects data about storage, network bandwidth, CPU utilization, etc., for each application or service deployed by a third party. Application developers and content providers can take advantage of close proximity to cellular subscribers and real-time RAN information.\\nMEC has been created using open standards and application programming interfaces (APIs), using common programming models, relevant tool chains and software development kits to encourage and expedite the development of new applications for the new MEC environment.\\n\\n\\n== Applications ==\\nSince MEC architecture has only recently been proposed, there are as yet very few applications that have adopted this architecture. However, many case studies have been proposed in recent articles. Some of the notable applications in mobile edge computing are computational offloading, content delivery, mobile big data analytics, edge video caching, collaborative computing, connected cars, smart venues, smart enterprises, healthcare, smartgrids, service function chaining, indoor positioning, etc.\\n\\n\\n== Current uses ==\\nSome applications which incorporate MEC were made available in 2015.

This royalty-free specification supports frame-accurate switching, making it suitable for live video production environments.\\n\\n\\n== Technology ==\\nNDI is designed to run over gigabit Ethernet with the NDI codec. It delivers 1080i high-definition video at variable data rates typically around 100 Mbit/s.\\nBy default, NDI uses multicast DNS to advertise sources on a local area network, such that NDI receivers can automatically discover and offer those sources. It also supports two other discovery modes (NDI Access, NDI Discovery Server) that allow for operations across subnets and without multicast DNS. Sources are created using an arbitrarily selected TCP port from a range of ports on the NDI senders. When a source is requested, a TCP connection is established on the appropriate port with the NDI receiver connecting to the NDI sender. NDI 3.x has options to use UDP multicast or unicast with forward error correction (FEC) instead of TCP, and can load balance streams across multiple network interface controllers (NICs) without using link aggregation. NDI version 4.0 introduces the Multi-TCP transport.\\nNDI carries video, multichannel uncompressed audio, and metadata. Metadata messages can be sent in both directions allowing the sender and receiver to message one another over the connection with arbitrary metadata in XML form. This directional metadata system allows for functionality such as active tally information fed back to sources to understand that they are on-air. NDI also allows senders to determine the number of connected receivers, so they can skip unnecessary processing and network bandwidth utilisation when there are no NDI receiver clients connected. NDI Receivers can opt to connect to various combinations of streams, to support, for instance, audio-only or metadata-only connections where video is not required.\\nThe NDI software development kit (SDK) is available for Windows, Linux, and MacOS, and has also been ported to iOS, tvOS, Android, Raspberry Pi, and FPGA. The Standard NDI SDK is available via a royalty-free proprietary license. The NDI Advanced SDK offers OEMs direct access to and from compressed data and other features, with a commercial license.\\n\\n\\n== Comparison of common IP video protocols ==\\nOther IP video protocols for use in professional video production (rather than IP video used for distribution to end users) include SMPTE 2022, SMPTE 2110, ASPEN (largely superseded by SMPTE 2110) and Sony NMI. There are clear differences in the technology used by these protocols. \\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nNDI was publicly revealed by NewTek on 8 September 2015 and was demonstrated at the International Broadcasting Convention in Amsterdam that week.  The first device shown using NDI was the NewTek TriCaster which delivered an NDI feed from each of its SDI inputs as well as four output feeds from its vision mixer. The TriCaster could also receive up to two NDI sources from other devices.\\nNewTek had previously created a predecessor of NDI called AirSend to get video from external devices into their TriCaster products. AirSend had been implemented by a number of character generator (CG) vendors including Vizrt and Chyron. In order to quickly bring these products into the NDI space, NewTek created a new driver to replace the existing AirSend driver, which could be installed on these existing AirSend-compatible devices, instantly converting them to NDI-compatible devices with no change required by the original CG vendors.\\nBirdDog was an early adopter and in 2018 released Studio NDI, an ASIC implementation of NDI. BirdDog went on to deliver NDI PTZ cameras, along with a host of software applications.\\nAnother early adopter of NDI was VMix, a Windows-based vision mixer that offers NDI inputs and outputs.

Trusted execution environments can be instantiated on a computer\\'s processing components such as a central processing unit (CPU) or a graphics processing unit (GPU).  In their various implementations, TEEs can provide different levels of isolation including virtual machine, individual application, or compute functions.\\nTypically, data in use in a computer\\'s compute components and memory exists in a decrypted state and can be vulnerable to examination or tampering by unauthorized software or administrators. According to the CCC, confidential computing protects data in use through a minimum of three properties:\\n\\nData confidentiality: \"Unauthorized entities cannot view data while it is in use within the TEE\".\\nData integrity: \"Unauthorized entities cannot add, remove, or alter data while it is in use within the TEE\".\\nCode integrity: \"Unauthorized entities cannot add, remove, or alter code executing in the TEE\".\\nIn addition to trusted execution environments, remote cryptographic attestation is an essential part of confidential computing.  The attestation process assesses the trustworthiness of a system and helps ensure that confidential data is released to a TEE only after it presents verifiable evidence that it is genuine and operating with an acceptable security posture.  It allows the verifying party to assess the trustworthiness of a confidential computing environment through an \"authentic, accurate, and timely report about the software and data state\" of that environment. \"Hardware-based attestation schemes rely on a trusted hardware component and associated firmware to execute attestation routines in a secure environment\". Without attestation, a compromised system could deceive others into trusting it, claim it is running certain software in a TEE, and potentially compromise the confidentiality or integrity of the data being processed or the integrity of the trusted code.\\n\\n\\n== Technical approaches ==\\nTechnical approaches to confidential computing may vary in which software, infrastructure and administrator elements are allowed to access confidential data. The \"trust boundary,\" which circumscribes a trusted computing base (TCB), defines which elements have the potential to access confidential data, whether they are acting benignly or maliciously.

A total of $1 billion in capital was pledged by Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Elon Musk, Reid Hoffman, Jessica Livingston, Peter Thiel, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Infosys. The actual collected total amount of contributions was only $130 million until 2019.\\nThe organization stated it would \"freely collaborate\" with other institutions and researchers by making some of its patents and research open to the public. OpenAI was initially run from Brockman\\'s living room. It was later headquartered at the Pioneer Building in the Mission District, San Francisco.\\nAccording to OpenAI\\'s charter, its founding mission is \"to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI)—by which we mean highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work—benefits all of humanity.\"\\nMusk and Altman stated in 2015 that they were partly motivated by concerns about AI safety and existential risk from artificial general intelligence. OpenAI stated that \"it\\'s hard to fathom how much human-level AI could benefit society\", and that it is equally difficult to comprehend \"how much it could damage society if built or used incorrectly\". The startup also wrote that AI \"should be an extension of individual human wills and, in the spirit of liberty, as broadly and evenly distributed as possible\", and that \"because of AI\\'s surprising history, it\\'s hard to predict when human-level AI might come within reach. When it does, it\\'ll be important to have a leading research institution which can prioritize a good outcome for all over its own self-interest.\" Co-chair Sam Altman expected a decades-long project that eventually surpasses human intelligence.\\nBrockman met with Yoshua Bengio, one of the \"founding fathers\" of deep learning, and drew up a list great AI researchers. Brockman was able to hire nine of them as the first employees in December 2015. OpenAI did not pay AI researchers salaries comparable to those of Facebook or Google.

Schell.\\nIn 1994, Grady Booch used the phrase continuous integration in Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications (2nd edition) to explain how, when developing using micro processes, \"internal releases represent a sort of continuous integration of the system, and exist to force closure of the micro process\".\\nIn 1997, Kent Beck and Ron Jeffries invented extreme programming (XP) while on the Chrysler Comprehensive Compensation System project, including continuous integration. Beck published about continuous integration in 1998, emphasising the importance of face-to-face communication over technological support. In 1999, Beck elaborated more in his first full book on Extreme Programming. CruiseControl, one of the first open-source CI tools, was released in 2001.\\nIn 2010, Timothy Fitz published an article detailing how IMVU\\'s engineering team had built and been using the first practical CD system. While his post was originally met with skepticism, it quickly caught on and found widespread adoption as part of the lean software development methodology, also based on IMVU.\\n\\n\\n== Practices ==\\nThe core activities of CI are developers co-locate code changes in a shared, integration area frequently and that the resulting integrated codebase is verified for correctness. The first part generally involves merging changes to a common version control branch. The second part generally involves automated processes including: building, testing and many other processes.\\nTypically, a server builds from the integration area frequently; i.e. after each commit or periodically like once a day. The server may perform quality control checks such as running unit tests and collect software quality metrics via processes such as static analysis and performance testing.\\n\\n\\n=== Build automation ===\\n\\nBuild automation is a best practice. Build automation tools automate building. \\nProponents of CI recommend that a single command should have the capability of building the system. \\nAutomation often includes automating the integration, which often includes deployment into a production-like environment. In many cases, the build script not only compiles binaries but also generates documentation, website pages, statistics and distribution media (such as Debian DEB, Red Hat RPM or Windows MSI files).\\n\\n\\n=== Atomic commits ===\\nCI requires the version control system to support atomic commits; i.e., all of a developer\\'s changes are handled as a single commit.\\n\\n\\n=== Committing changes ===\\nWhen making a code change, a developer creates a branch that is a copy of the current codebase. As other changes are committed to the repository, this copy diverges from the latest version.\\nThe longer development continues on a branch without merging to the integration branch, the greater the risk of multiple integration conflicts and failures when the developer branch is eventually merged back. When developers submit code to the repository they must first update their code to reflect the changes in the repository since they took their copy. The more changes the repository contains, the more work developers must do before submitting their own changes.\\nEventually, the repository may become so different from the developers\\' baselines that they enter what is sometimes referred to as \"merge hell\", or \"integration hell\", '), Document(metadata={'title': 'Meteorology', 'summary': \"Meteorology is the scientific study of the Earth's atmosphere and short-term atmospheric phenomena (i.e., weather), with a focus on weather forecasting.

Ancient religions believed meteorological phenomena to be under the control of the gods. The ability to predict rains and floods based on annual cycles was evidently used by humans at least from the time of agricultural settlement if not earlier. Early approaches to predicting weather were based on astrology and were practiced by priests. The Egyptians had rain-making rituals as early as 3500 BC. \\nAncient Indian Upanishads contain mentions of clouds and seasons.

In 2005 and 2006, both Intel (VT-x) and AMD (AMD-V) introduced limited hardware virtualization support that allowed simpler virtualization software but offered very few speed benefits. Greater hardware support, which allowed substantial speed improvements, came with later processor models.\\n\\n\\n== Software-based virtualization ==\\nThe following discussion focuses only on virtualization of the x86 architecture protected mode.\\nIn protected mode the operating system kernel runs in kernel space at the most privileged level (ring 0) that allows it to configure the MMU, manage physical memory, and directly control I/O peripherals, while applications run in user space at a lower privilege level (such as ring 3), where they are confined to their own virtual address spaces and must invoke system calls to request I/O operations or other privileged services from the kernel.\\nIn software-based virtualization, a host OS has direct access to hardware while the guest operating systems, have limited access to hardware, similarly to other user space application of the host OS. One approach used in x86 software-based virtualization to implement this mechanism is called ring deprivileging, which involves running the guest OS at a ring higher (lesser privileged) than 0, so that attempts to execute privileged instructions can be intercepted and handled by the hypervisor.\\nThree techniques made virtualization of protected mode possible:\\n\\nBinary translation is used to rewrite certain ring 0 instructions in terms of ring 3 instructions, such as POPF, that would otherwise fail silently or behave differently when executed above ring 0, making the classic trap-and-emulate virtualization impossible. To improve performance, the translated basic blocks need to be cached in a coherent way that detects code patching (used in VxDs for instance), the reuse of pages by the guest OS, or even self-modifying code.\\nA number of key data structures used by a processor need to be shadowed. Because most operating systems use paged virtual memory, and granting the guest OS direct access to the MMU would mean loss of control by the virtualization manager, some of the work of the x86 MMU needs to be duplicated in software for the guest OS using a technique known as shadow page tables. This involves denying the guest OS any access to the actual page table entries by trapping access attempts and emulating them instead in software. The x86 architecture uses hidden state to store segment descriptors in the processor, so once the segment descriptors have been loaded into the processor, the memory from which they have been loaded may be overwritten and there is no way to get the descriptors back from the processor. Shadow descriptor tables must therefore be used to track changes made to the descriptor tables by the guest OS.\\nI/O device emulation: Unsupported devices on the guest OS must be emulated by a device emulator that runs in the host OS.\\nThese techniques incur some performance overhead due to lack of MMU virtualization support, as compared to a VM running on a natively virtualizable architecture such as the IBM System/370.\\nOn traditional mainframes, the classic type 1 hypervisor was self-standing and did not depend on any operating system or run any user applications itself. In contrast, the first x86 virtualization products were aimed at workstation computers, and ran a guest OS inside a host OS by embedding the hypervisor in a kernel module that ran under the host OS (type 2 hypervisor).\\nThere has been some controversy whether the x86 architecture with no hardware assistance is virtualizable as described by Popek and Goldberg.

Use by a wider audience only came in 1995 when restrictions on the use of the Internet to carry commercial traffic were lifted.\\nIn the early to mid-1980s, most Internet access was from personal computers and workstations directly connected to local area networks (LANs) or from dial-up connections using modems and analog telephone lines. LANs typically operated at 10 Mbit/s while modem data-rates grew from 1200 bit/s in the early 1980s to 56 kbit/s by the late 1990s. Initially, dial-up connections were made from terminals or computers running terminal-emulation software to terminal servers on LANs. These dial-up connections did not support end-to-end use of the Internet protocols and only provided terminal-to-host connections. The introduction of network access servers supporting the Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) and later the point-to-point protocol (PPP) extended the Internet protocols and made the full range of Internet services available to dial-up users; although slower, due to the lower data rates available using dial-up.\\nAn important factor in the rapid rise of Internet access speed has been advances in MOSFET (MOS transistor) technology. The MOSFET invented at Bell Labs between 1955 and 1960 following Frosch and Derick discoveries, is the building block of the Internet telecommunications networks. The laser, originally demonstrated by Charles H. Townes and Arthur Leonard Schawlow in 1960, was adopted for MOS light-wave systems around 1980, which led to exponential growth of Internet bandwidth. Continuous MOSFET scaling has since led to online bandwidth doubling every 18 months (Edholm\\'s law, which is related to Moore\\'s law), with the bandwidths of telecommunications networks rising from bits per second to terabits per second.\\nBroadband Internet access, often shortened to just broadband, is simply defined as \"Internet access that is always on, and faster than the traditional dial-up access\" and so covers a wide range of technologies. The core of these broadband Internet technologies are complementary MOS (CMOS) digital circuits, the speed capabilities of which were extended with innovative design techniques. Broadband connections are typically made using a computer\\'s built in Ethernet networking capabilities, or by using a NIC expansion card.\\nMost broadband services provide a continuous \"always on\" connection; there is no dial-in pr')]\n"

      "Summary: The Semantic Web, sometimes known as Web 3.0, is an extension of the World Wide Web through standards set by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The goal of the Semantic Web is to make Internet data machine-readable.\n",
      "To enable the encoding of semantics with the data, technologies such as Resource Description Framework (RDF) and Web Ontology Language (OWL) are used. These technologies are used to formally represent metadata. For example, ontology can describe concepts, relationships between entities, and categories of things. These embedded semantics offer significant advantages such as reasoning over data and operating with heterogeneous data sources.\n",
      "These standards promote common data formats and exchange protocols on the Web, fundamentally the RDF. According to the W3C, \"The Semantic Web provides a common framework that allows data to be shared and reused across application, enterprise, and community boundaries.\" The Semantic Web is therefore regarded as an integrator across different content and information applications and systems.\n",

According to the Stack Overflow Developer Survey, React is one of the most commonly used web technologies.\n",
      "React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js and React Router. Because React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the DOM, React applications often rely on libraries for routing and other client-side functionality. A key advantage of React is that it only re-renders those parts of the page that have changed, avoiding unnecessary re-rendering of unchanged DOM elements.

The field takes inspiration from biological neuroscience and is centered around stacking artificial neurons into layers and \"training\" them to process data. The adjective \"deep\" refers to the use of multiple layers (ranging from three to several hundred or thousands) in the network. Methods used can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.\n",
      "Some common deep learning network architectures include fully connected networks, deep belief networks, recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, generative adversarial networks, transformers, and neural radiance fields. These architectures have been applied to fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, machine translation, bioinformatics, drug design, medical image analysis, climate science, material inspection and board game programs, where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance.\n",
      "Early forms of neural networks were inspired by information processing and distributed communication nodes in biological systems, particularly the human brain. However, current neural networks do not intend to model the brain function of organisms, and are generally seen as low-quality models for that purpose.\n",

It can be used in Python as well as JavaScript environments, which means that it can be used by a large number of developers. In contrast to more basic chain-based systems, LangGraph is a graph-based system that coordinates AI workflows. This means that instead of a linear sequence of steps, an application is modeled as a directed graph of nodes and edges. [...] Imagine creating an AI application in which several language model agents collaborate on a complex task. It may be difficult to coordinate these agents, keep context across steps and achieve reliable results. LangGraph is a tool for solving this challenge. It is a framework on LangChain ecosystem that gives a way to define, coordinate, and execute multiple LLM (Large Language Model) agents in complex workflows. In other words, for anyone wondering what is LangGraph, it is a stateful [...] workflow continues. To put it briefly, LangGraph is about coordinating various AI elements to operate in coordination, have memory of previous interactions, and enable complex control flows within an application.',\n",

      "\n",
      "Sometimes, even the smartest AI agents need a little human guidance. LangGraph allows you to easily integrate human input into the process. You can pause your AI agent, have a person check its plan, tweak things if needed, and then continue the workflow. This makes LangGraph perfect for creating reliable AI systems that need to be trusted in business settings—where AI can do most of the work, but a human keeps an eye on the really critical decisions. [...] Compared to other AI frameworks, LangGraph gives you more power and flexibility. If you’ve used LangChain before, you know it’s amazing for building chains of LLM-powered tasks, like calling an API or generating responses. LangGraph goes beyond those linear chains—it lets you create decision-making loops, pauses for human checks, and elaborate multi-agent setups.\n",

      "With LangGraph, automating business processes and workflows becomes straightforward. Intelligent agents can be designed to handle tasks such as document processing, approval workflows, and data analysis. By defining clear workflows and leveraging LangGraph's state management, these tools can execute complex sequences of actions without human intervention, reducing errors and increasing productivity.\n",

      "These agents can execute complex workflows, interact with other systems, and adapt to new information dynamically. LangGraph's structured framework ensures that each agent operates efficiently and effectively, making it suitable for tasks like automated customer support, data processing, and system monitoring. [...] LangGraph ensures agents execute in the correct order and that necessary information is exchanged seamlessly. This coordination is vital for complex applications where multiple agents need to work together to achieve a common goal. By managing the flow of data and the sequence of operations, LangGraph allows developers to focus on the high-level logic of their applications rather than the intricacies of agent coordination.\n",

       "## LangGraph: Revolutionizing AI Product Development with Agent Orchestration\n",
       "\n",
       "### Summary\n",
       "\n",
       "LangGraph, a library built on top of LangChain, is emerging as a game-changing framework for AI product development, particularly in building sophisticated, stateful, multi-agent applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) [1, 2]. It addresses the limitations of linear chains and simple prompts by enabling developers to orchestrate intelligent, dynamic agents capable of solving complex, multi-step tasks [5]. LangGraph facilitates the creation of AI systems that can reason, act, and provide context-aware responses, marking a significant shift from traditional assistant frameworks [14].\n",
       "\n",
       "One of the key advantages of LangGraph is its ability to manage state across execution cycles, ensuring deterministic execution and transparency in debugging [1, 3]. Unlike LangChain's agent-centric model, where LLMs dynamically decide the next step, LangGraph introduces explicit control over the execution flow, making AI workflow development more reliable and scalable [3]. This is achieved through a graph-based architecture that utilizes nodes (functions or LangChain runnable items) and edges (execution and data flow) to define workflows [1].\n",
       "\n",
       "LangGraph's architecture supports dynamic reasoning loops, allowing agents to \"think, act, and observe\" before finalizing an answer [14]. This iterative process enables agents to analyze questions, execute actions using tools or APIs, assess the results, and repeat the process until a satisfactory answer is generated [14]. This ReAct paradigm (Reasoning and Acting) allows AI agents to reason and act based on real-time inputs, breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps [15, 16]. Furthermore, LangGraph allows for the integration of human intervention in the loop, which is helpful for debugging or modifying graph states [15].\n",
       "\n",
       "The ability to visualize the graph structure serves as a valuable debugging tool, especially as systems grow in complexity [16]. Moreover, LangGraph's streaming capability enables the creation of real-time, interactive experiences [16]. By providing a structured, scalable, and resilient framework, LangGraph empowers developers to build more reliable, production-ready AI solutions [5].\n",

       "\n",
       "## Introduction\n",
       "Generative AI is revolutionizing drug discovery by accelerating timelines, reducing costs, and enabling the design of novel molecules for previously \"undruggable\" targets. This report explores how generative AI is transforming early-stage research, enabling faster progression from concept to viable drug candidate. We examine how AI is impacting targeted therapies through the design of novel compounds with tailored functional properties. Finally, we highlight AI's role in enhancing precision, reducing timelines and costs, and enabling AI-driven computer-aided drug design, showcasing its potential in addressing unmet medical needs.\n",

       "\n",
       "Generative AI is revolutionizing drug discovery by accelerating timelines, reducing costs, and enabling the design of novel molecules for previously \"undruggable\" targets [1, 4]. Unlike traditional methods, generative AI can create entirely new molecules tailored to specific disease targets [1]. This technology is particularly impactful in early-stage drug discovery, where it can generate new molecules tailored for specific properties, thereby revolutionizing various aspects of the drug development process [4]. Generative AI's ability to analyze vast datasets and identify complex patterns allows researchers to explore chemical spaces that were previously inaccessible through traditional methods [1, 5].\n",
       "\n",
       "Generative AI, particularly generative adversarial networks (GANs), is enabling the design of novel compounds with tailored functional properties [4]. GANs consist of a generator and a discriminator, which work together to create synthetic data, such as novel molecules, by learning from real data distributions [6, 7]. Deep learning models, especially GANs and autoencoders, are accelerating *de novo* drug design [1]. Generative AI can develop superior text, concept art, visual art, code, animation, speech, music, and video [3]. For instance, it is possible to synthesize good-quality visual representation using diffusion models [3]. AI models are used in molecular property prediction, molecule generation, virtual screening, and synthesis planning [4].\n",
       "\n",
       "Several companies are at the forefront of this revolution. For example, Insilico Medicine utilized AI to significantly reduce the time and cost of developing a drug for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [1]. Insilico Medicine also announced positive results from Phase I studies of ISM5411, an AI-designed drug for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [16]. ISM5411, a novel gut-restricted and PHD-specific inhibitor, was designed and optimized using Insilico's Chemistry42 generative reinforcement learning platform [16]. The AI platform ranked the PHD1/2-HIF1α signaling axis as a top potential target [15]. NVIDIA's BioNeMo platform is also accelerating drug discovery by providing tools to develop and deploy foundation models, enabling scientists to integrate generative AI to reduce or replace experiments [1, 5]. Merck is scaling its internal generative AI platform across its late-phase pipeline to overcome bottlenecks in drug discovery [3]. Small to midsize biopharma companies are also beginning to leverage generative AI, with startups specifically designed to implement these technologies finding success [2]. AION Labs, backed by major pharmaceutical and technology companies, focuses on adopting AI and machine learning in pharmaceutical discovery and development [8]. Generate:Biomedicines specializes in using machine learning to design and optimize proteins for therapeutic applications, securing significant partnerships to further its research [9].\n",
       "\n",
       "However, the integration of generative AI into drug discovery workflows is not without its challenges. One major hurdle is data quality, as AI models rely on robust and unbiased datasets to generate effective drug candidates [1]. The sheer size of chemical diversity that needs to be searched, combined with the lack of readily available data, poses a significant challenge for generative AI techniques [2]. Furthermore, regulatory uncertainty and the need for cultural and technical shifts within pharmaceutical companies add to the complexity of adopting these new technologies [1]. While challenges such as interpretability and computational demands remain, ongoing research is addressing these issues, paving the way for GANs to play a crucial role in accelerating drug discovery [4]. Generative AI shows promise in IBD care, but concerns about accuracy, consistency, and outdated information highlight the need for expert oversight before clinical integration [17]. AI-driven tools like natural language processing (NLP) are improving clinical trial recruitment by analyzing clinical notes and unstructured data to identify potential participants that might be missed by traditional screening methods [19].\n",
       "\n",
       "Despite these challenges, generative AI is already demonstrating its potential to accelerate drug discovery. By enabling faster progression from concept to viable drug candidate through AI-powered predictions and simulations, generative AI is poised to revolutionize early-stage research in pharmaceutical companies [6]. AI integration has the potential to hasten the creation of novel treatments, save costs, and improve patient outcomes [5]. Alliances between AI and pharmaceutical companies are increasing and focus on the AI-driven development of drug candidates in a faster and more affordable manner [1].\n",
